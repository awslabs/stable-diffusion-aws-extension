# Quotas

To increase the quota of the Amazon SageMaker ml.g4dn.2xlarge instance in your AWS account, you can follow these steps:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Service Quotas console.
2. Select 'AWS Services' from the navigation panel.
3. Select 'Amazon SageMaker' from the list, or type the service name in the search box.
4. Request a quota increase: If the quota is adjustable, you can select the button or name, then select 'Request quota increase'.
5. Change the quota value: Enter the new value in the 'Change quota value' field. The new value must be greater than the current value.
6. Submit the request: Click 'Request' to submit your quota increase request to AWS.

[Note]Please note that some AWS services may only be available in certain regions. If you have quota increase requests in different regions, make sure to first select the appropriate region.

After you submit a quota increase request, you can track its status:

1. View the request status: Return to the Service Quotas console and select 'Dashboard' from the navigation panel. For pending requests, select the status of the request to open the request receipt. The initial status of the request is 'Pending'. When the status changes to 'Quota Requested', you will see a case number at AWS Support. Select the case number to open your request receipt.
2. Check the quota request history: To view any pending or recently resolved requests, select 'Quota request history' from the Service Quotas console navigation panel.

Remember, quota increase requests do not receive priority support and may take some time to process. If you have an urgent request, consider contacting AWS Support directly.
