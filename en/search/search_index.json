(Note: AWS credentials are not required in AWS WebUI)</li> <li>API Gateway will route requests to Lambda with different functions according to URL prefixes to implement corresponding tasks (for example, model uploading, checkpoint merging), model training, and model inference. At the same time, the Lambda function records operational metadata into DynamoDB (eg, inferred parameters, model name) for subsequent query and correlation.</li> <li>During the training process, the Step Function will be called to orchestrate the training process, which includes using Amazon SageMaker for training and SNS for training status notification. During the inference process, the Lambda function will call Amazon SageMaker for asynchronous inference.
